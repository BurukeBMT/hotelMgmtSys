# Run Entire Program TODO

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Install dependencies for the main React app (`npm install` in root directory)
- [x] Start the React development server (`npm start` in root directory)

## Notes

- Payment API is already deployed on Render at 'https://payment-api-f7uu.onrender.com/api', so no need to run locally.
- Root index.js server not needed as per README and user confirmation.
- Frontend will run at http://localhost:3000.
- Dependencies installed successfully (1518 packages audited, 37 vulnerabilities noted but not critical).
- React development server started.
